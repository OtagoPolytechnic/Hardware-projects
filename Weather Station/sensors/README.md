# Weather station sensor code

### Wind/rain
Wind_sensors_I2c_Code contains Arduino code for two devices. Adafruit Feather board and the LilyGo LORA32 board. The feather board reads the wind/rain sensors and sends the data using I2C to the LilyGo, which sends the data to The Things Network using LoRaWAN.
